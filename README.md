# Starbucks-Udacity-CapStone-Project
# Installation
The most important library for this project is Python version of Anaconda Distribution. It installs all necessary packages for analysis and building models.

# Introducing a Dataset
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.


# Project Motivation
In this project I have tried to build a Machine learning model to predict response of a customer towards a Starbuck offer. 
Some of the questions that we will try to answer:

Q1. What is the average age of males and females in the customer profile?

Q2. What is the average income and how does it differs in males and females?

Q3. Gender wise income distribution

Q4. Gender wise age distribution

Q5. What percent of customers enrolled in an year?

Q6. What is the distribuion of male and female per year in the membership program?

Q7. what are the different types of offers?

Q8. How does customers responds(event) to different typesof offers?

Q9.How male and female respond to any offer?


# File Description
There are three datasets provided:

1.Portfolio - contains 10 different offers ids and each offer can be any one of the three offer types. The offers are further subcategorised based on difficulty and duration.

2.Profile - dataset contains information regarding customer demographics including age, gender, income, and the date they created an account for Starbucks Rewards app.

3.Transcript - dataset contains all the instances when a customer made a purchase, viewed an offer, received an offer, and completed an offer. Also sometimes customers have completed an offer but never actually viewed the offer (transaction), then this does not count as a successful offer as the offer could not have changed the outcome.
